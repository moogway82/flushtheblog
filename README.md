============

Flush the Blog - possibly the crappiest blog platform in the world.

Just learning more about PHP web app development by writing a blog from scratch for fun.

Uses really basic routing, and a really basic Controller -> View setup.

Seriousnly don't expect anyone to use the rubblish, it's just a bit of fun in PHP!
